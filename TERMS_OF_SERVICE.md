## 2. Description of Service

Salva is a parental screen-lock application for Android devices that helps parents and caregivers protect their device screen from accidental touches by children. The App provides:

- **Premium features** including Ghost Mode, Screen Sentinel, Smart Rules, Screen Time Limits, Family Dashboard, Remote Control, and other automation features
- **Household management** for linking and managing multiple family devices

## 7. Accessibility Service Usage

Salva uses Android's Accessibility Service to provide core functionality including:
- Touch blocking and gesture interception
- Content scanning (Screen Sentinel) for parental content monitoring
- App-switch detection for Smart Rules and Auto-Protect
- Hardware key interception in Protected Mode

**By enabling the Accessibility Service for Salva, you acknowledge and agree that:**
- The Service has broad access to screen content and device interactions
- All content scanning is performed **entirely on-device** — no raw screen text is transmitted to any server
- Only category labels, app names, and short snippets (max 100 characters) are stored as content alerts
- You are responsible for ensuring this use complies with applicable laws in your jurisdiction

---

## 8. Content Monitoring Disclaimer

### 8.1 Screen Sentinel
Screen Sentinel is a content monitoring tool designed to alert parents to potentially age-inappropriate content. It is **not** a comprehensive content filter and does not block or prevent access to any content.

**Limitations:**
- Keyword-based detection may produce false positives or miss some content
- It does not scan images, audio, or video — only on-screen text
- Effectiveness depends on the language and context of content
- It is a supplementary tool, not a replacement for active parental supervision

### 8.2 No Guarantee of Effectiveness
We do not guarantee that Salva will detect all inappropriate content or prevent all unauthorized device usage. Anti-bypass protection effectiveness varies by device manufacturer, Android version, and OEM customization.

---

## 9. Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Our collection, use, and protection of your personal information is governed by our [Privacy Policy](https://salva-app.com/privacy), which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.

Key privacy principles:
- No ads and no ad tracking
- No third-party analytics
- Content scanning is 100% on-device
- Cloud-synced data is limited to what is necessary for household management
- You can delete your data at any time through the in-app "Delete My Data" feature

## 14. Device Compatibility

Salva requires Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher. While we strive for broad compatibility, we cannot guarantee full functionality on all Android devices due to:
- OEM-specific modifications (Samsung One UI, Xiaomi MIUI, Huawei EMUI, etc.)
- Manufacturer-specific battery optimization that may terminate background services
- Custom gesture navigation that may interfere with touch blocking
- Accessibility Service restrictions imposed by some manufacturers

We provide an in-app Permission Setup Guide with OEM-specific instructions to help maximize compatibility.
